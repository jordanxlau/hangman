# hangman
I created this hangman game in Python in the summer before 8th grade at a UofT summer camp. It was my first introduction to coding. I keep 2 branches on here, main and inefficient. I originally coded it inefficiently then realized I could use an array to streamline the game. I keep both branches as they were coded at the time for posterity. I don't intend to delete the 'inefficient' branch.
